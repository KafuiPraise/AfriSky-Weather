## Introduction :globe_with_meridians:

AfriSky Weather is a simple and intuitive weather application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the world. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data.

AfriSky Weather is more than just a weather application; it's a collaborative endeavor born out of the shared passion of three innovatorsâ€”Freda Tsorme-Dzebu, Matilda Dogbatsey, and Rosina Antwi. Our goal was to create a weather companion that not only delivered real-time updates but also added a personalized touch to enhance the user experience.

## Inspiration :sparkles:

The inspiration for AfriSky Weather arose from our collective fascination with the intersection of technology and meteorology. As weather enthusiasts and nature lovers, we envisioned a tool that not only provided accurate weather information but also reflected the beauty and diversity of nature through a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Technical Challenges :hammer_and_wrench:

The journey to create AfriSky Weather was not without its challenges. One significant hurdle was perfecting the responsive design to ensure a consistent and enjoyable user experience across various devices. Additionally, integrating external services like OpenWeatherMap posed complexities that required thorough collaboration, documentation study, and problem-solving.

## Next Iterations

### 1. **5-Day Weather Forecast**

**Objective:** :thinking: Provide users with a comprehensive outlook by integrating a 5-day weather forecast feature.

**Implementation:** Leveraging OpenWeatherMap's API, we aim to fetch extended weather forecasts, offering insights into temperature trends, precipitation, and more over the next five days. Users can plan their activities with a more detailed understanding of the weather.

### 2. **Interactive Map Integration**

**Objective:** :thinking: Enhance user engagement by incorporating an interactive map feature.

**Implementation:** The inclusion of an interactive map will allow users to visually explore weather patterns and conditions in different regions. This dynamic feature provides an intuitive and engaging way for users to interact with weather information.

### 3. **Temperature Unit Selection**

**Objective:** :thinking: Cater to user preferences by allowing them to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature readings.

**Implementation:** We will introduce a user-friendly setting that enables users to switch between temperature units based on their preference. This customization feature ensures a personalized experience, allowing users to view temperature data in their preferred units.
